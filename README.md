# Dotfiles
Dotfiles for all of my linux machines - Feel free to use them, however they require the following dependancies

# Installation
I use GNU stow to keep the dotfiles in line. Just clone the repository into your home directory, cd into it, and use `stow *`. 
You may want to store your current dotfiles elsewhere first. I suggest making a similar directory, and using stow to manage it. That way you could just as easily revery back to the original.
